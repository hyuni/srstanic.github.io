## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/srstanic/srstanic.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/srstanic/srstanic.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# TextLog v1.0

TextLog is a minimalist, distraction-free and content-focused Jekyll theme with flexible content width. TextLog does not have **about page**, instead TextLog has a quite simple homepage; a brief introduction text (about the blog itself or the author bio) and then goes a list of post titles. Font or typeface used is [Droid Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Droid+Sans) from Google Web Font. Droid Sans is one of the best web fonts with highest readability. TextLog supports [Disqus comment](https://disqus.com/) and [tags](https://heiswayi.github.io/textlog/tagged/).
